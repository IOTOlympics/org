IOT Olympics is a program to create opensource & opendata IOT solutions using LoRa and beacon technology.
Between Feb 2016 and July 2016 (for the moment), we will be building IOT applications around sports & active lifestyle.
The goal is to implement several of these prototypes in the Oosterpark in Amsterdam.
